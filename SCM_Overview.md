# Effective Digitalisation in Supply Chain Management, including all systems involved in business processes like- ERP, CRM & communication tools

## Abstract  
This document explores the role of Supply Chain Management in modern businesses, with a focus on how digitisation is transforming the flow of goods, information, and finances across suppliers, retailers, customers, and other key stakeholders. It introduces the fundamental elements of SCM, highlights the benefits and challenges of digital transformation, and sets the foundation for further analysis of IoT, ERP, CRM, and communication tools. The review specifically considers challenges faced by the SCM sector in Australia and examines how digitisation-driven solutions are being applied in practice, while also addressing the ethical considerations involved in their implementation. Throughout the document, concepts are explained in clear, non-technical language, supported by real-world examples and case studies, to ensure accessibility for readers from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.

## Introduction  
- Define SCM: managing flow of goods, services, information, and finances.

Include a **diagram** later (you can upload an image like `scm_flow.png`).  

## Role of Digitisation in SCM  
- **Convenience for suppliers**: better demand forecasting, less wastage.  
- **Convenience for retailers**: real-time inventory visibility.  
- **Convenience for customers**: accurate delivery timelines, product availability.  

## Example Case Studies  
- Amazon’s digitised warehouses (robots + IoT tracking).  
- Walmart’s supplier management system.
